# iCloud

### Problem
When I download my pictures from iCloud to my Windows computer they are never in chronological order eventhough they are displayed in order in iCloud.

### Solution
Store the file names in chronological order. Then rename every file after downloading.

#### Two scripts

script 1: Get name and date time for every picture and video in iCloud and store it in a txt file.

Download (manually) all the pictures/videos from iCloud.

script 2: Rename every file according to the list of name-timestamp in the txt file from script 1.
